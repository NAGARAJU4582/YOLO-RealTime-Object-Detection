## YOLO Real Time Object Detection

This project implements a real time object detection via video, webcam and image detection using YOLO algorithm. YOLO is a object detection algorithm which stand for You Only Look Once. I've implemented the algorithm from scratch in Python using pre-trained weights.Real time detection can be use via command prompt or GUI.

Yolo is a deep learning algorythm which came out on may 2016 and it became quickly so popular because itâ€™s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorythm.
With yolo we can detect real time objects at a relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second while with a CPU around a frame per second.

OpenCV dnn module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow.

## About YOLO
YOLO is a deep learning object detection algorithm introduced in **May 2016**. It became popular due to its **high speed** compared with previous detection algorithms. YOLO detects objects in real-time with high accuracy.

OpenCV `dnn` module is used to run inference on pre-trained models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch, and TensorFlow.
